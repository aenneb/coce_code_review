# costofcontrol
 javascript for amazon mechanical turk experiments on the cost of cognitive control processes

in /cost, the experimental code (including images, custom plugins, and pre-built jspsych functions)
cost.html is the main experimental page (initializes all, loads up entire experimental timeline)

in /pilotdata, anonymous data from 10 pilots on two versions of the task

v1: cost of control with the BDM, a detection task, plain n-back training, and a combined n-back and detection task (based on Kool & Botvinick 2014)
v2: cost of control with the BDM, and two versions of an n-switch task

questionnaires (need for cognition and demographics) on both versions

the outer layer is snippets of (messy, inefficient) matlab code for analysis of pilot data
will get considerably cleaned up for real data
